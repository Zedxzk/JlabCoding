|      checkStatus.py      |                             Designed to analyse the working output log of jobs.

The file name is decided by a variable called `res_file` in the script(or more specifically, `res_old_{he_version}_{extra_info}.txt`). Messages are printed in the terminal with varied colors depending on the  severity of the error.(Red > Yellow > Blue) | See  the details below |
